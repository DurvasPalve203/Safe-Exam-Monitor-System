AI‚ÄëPowered Real‚ÄëTime Exam Monitoring System
Project Synopsis
Online examinations are increasingly relied upon in education, but preserving academic integrity without intrusive or expensive tools remains a challenge. This project implements a privacy-first, AI-driven proctoring platform built with React, TypeScript, Supabase, and TensorFlow.js (TFJS).

By running all detection directly in the student‚Äôs browser (e.g., extra person detection, mobile device identification, tab/window focus tracking), the system ensures fairness and accountability while never transmitting raw video to servers. Only violation events and metadata are securely logged.

Review of Literature
CNN-based detectors (MobileNet family, COCO‚ÄëSSD) ‚Üí efficient person/device recognition in real time.
Computer vision for anomaly detection ‚Üí bounding box overlays aid interpretability.
Browser APIs (JavaScript Visibility API, focus/blur events) ‚Üí detect tab switching.
Existing solutions (ProctorU, Mettl, Examity) ‚Üí closed-source, expensive, and opaque.
Open-source AI & cloud integration ‚Üí a community-driven alternative, emphasizing reproducibility and privacy.
Problem Statement and Objectives
Current systems either stream sensitive data to third parties or require costly licensed software. What is missing is a transparent, affordable, privacy-respecting real‚Äëtime invigilation system.

Objectives:

Detect multiple persons and cell phones in the camera feed
Overlay bounding boxes with confidence scores for interpretability
Monitor tab switches and window unfocusing
Alert examiners via Supabase edge functions (emails)
Track violation history in the UI and auto‚Äëterminate persistent offenders
Provide a configurable, extensible architecture
System Architecture
Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite
TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for UI components
WebRTC: webcam stream capture
TensorFlow.js (coco‚Äëssd model): real‚Äëtime object/person/device detection
Framer Motion: animations & transitions
Backend (Supabase)

Auth: User profiles & exam sessions
Database: exam_sessions, proctor_events (optional detailed logs)
Edge Functions: Send email alerts on violation events
Storage: migration management, config files
Data Flow

Camera stream captured in browser
AI loop (every ~2s) detects people/objects
Smoothed detections ‚Üí violation triggers
UI shows overlays + warnings timeline
Violation counts stored in Supabase
Email alerts sent automatically if threshold exceeded
Current Implementation (MVP)
Real-time webcam monitoring in browser
Multiple person + phone detection with TFJS coco‚Äëssd
Violation smoothing & cooldown logic to reduce false positives
Tab/window event monitoring with configurable thresholds
Supabase integration: auth, violations DB, email functions
UI dashboard + violation history timeline for students and proctors
Session auto-termination after repeated violations
